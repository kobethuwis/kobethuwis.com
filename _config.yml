description: I am a youthful AI engineer, researcher and robotics developer. Programming and working with computers in general has been a passion for quite some time. In love with automation and minimizing repetitive work, which is why Iâ€™m able to focus on efficient & application-oriented learning, developing and problem solving. Switching views, working on agile projects and changing approaches often motivate me to study new topics, tackle hard challenges and deliver results.
